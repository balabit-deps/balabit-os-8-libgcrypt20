Subject: [PATCH 5/6] Set vZZ.16b register to zero before use in armv8 gcm
 implementation

* cipher/cipher-gcm-armv8-aarch64-ce.S
(_gcry_ghash_setup_armv8_ce_pmull): Set vZZ to zero.
--

Cherry-pick of master commit 79ed620ec46adbb08f5cea6a4865a95a436e4109.

Reported by "Marvin W." at https://dev.gnupg.org/D497:
>
> The register vZZ.16b is expected to be always 0 throughout the macros
> in cipher/cipher-gcm-armv8-aarch64-ce.S. The PMUL_128x128 and REDUCTION
> macros are used in gcry_ghash_setup_armv8_ce_pmull function, however that
> function does not set vZZ.16b to zero. If previous use left `vZZ.16b
> non-zero before gcry_ghash_setup_armv8_ce_pmull is called, this will cause
> invalid GCM auth tag results.
>
> The patch resets vZZ.16b to 0 at the beginning of
> gcry_ghash_setup_armv8_ce_pmull.
